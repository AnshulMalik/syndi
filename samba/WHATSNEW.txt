UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================


net ads setspn
---------------

There is a new 'net ads setspn' sub command for managing Windows SPN(s)
on the AD. This command aims to give the basic functionaility that is
provided on windows by 'setspn.exe' e.g. ability to add, delete and list
Windows SPN(s) stored in a Windows AD Computer object.

The format of the command is:

net ads setspn list [machine]
net ads setspn [add | delete ] SPN [machine]

'machine' is the name of the computer account on the AD that is to be managed.
If 'machine' is not specified the name of the 'client' running the command
is used instead.

The format of a Windows SPN is
  'serviceclass/host:port/servicename' (servicename and port are optional)

serviceclass/host is generally sufficient to specify a host based service.

net ads keytab changes
----------------------
net ads keytab add no longer attempts to convert the passed serviceclass
(e.g. nfs, html etc.) into a Windows SPN which is added to the Windows AD
computer object. By default just the keytab file is modified.

A new keytab subcommand 'add_update_ads' has been added to preserve the
legacy behaviour. However the new 'net ads setspn add' subcommand should
really be used instead.

net ads keytab create no longer tries to generate SPN(s) from existing
entries in a keytab file. If it is required to add Windows SPN(s) then
'net ads setspn add' should be used instead.
